## Requirements

Required packages are given in the r_reqs.R file which can be opened and run in R on your own machine, however we have used Jupyter notebooks throughout the report and this should mean that you can observe the results of all the code easily without having to download and run it yourself.

## Data

Data accessed in the report is found in the /Data directory of the GitHub repository.

## Individual Work

You can see our individual work in each of our individual directories in the repository.
