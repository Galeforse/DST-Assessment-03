Our project is an equal split amongst each project member.

## Reading Order

All Report content is found in the /Report directory and takes the following structure:
* 01 - Introduction
* 02 - Data & Data Import
* 03 - Data Pre-processing
* 04 - TFIDF
* 05 - LDA
* 06 - LDA tSNE
* 07 - Performance Analysis
* 08 - Conclusion

The folder 00 - Visualisations will be referenced in the performance analysis document and contains exported visualisations from the code.

## Data

Data accessed in the report is found in the /Data directory of the GitHub repository.

Most of the scripts throughout the report will access data through calling the `url` of data found in the repository; however if you wish to recreate some of the data creation process small amounts of code may need to be rewritten in order to fit your desktop environment (for instance some of the code writes to a specific directory on a group members computer, which will not exist on your computer)

## Individual Work

You can see our individual work in each of our individual directories in the repository.
